# Flutterwing Academy

Born from the idea of my 3 year old son, who told me one morning he didn't want to go to nursery. That his nursery and all his fellow caass mates had magically disappeared and gone to 'Flutterwing', in a town called 'Askenberg'. The fictional daycare and nursery center is now loosely based in the Harry Potter universe and the schools website is now fully functioning across all devices.

It's targetted towards wizarding parents who wish for their children to have a magical upbringing away from home. The intent is to provide the parents with knowledge about the school, it's current location and why they should choose Flutterwing.

## UX

### Site Purpose:

### Communication:

Information is easily accessible and follows an intuitive design. The design is repeated through each page of the site and the current page is always highlighted so the user knows where they are currently.

## Design

### Colour Scheme:

The colour palette was chosen from 'Colorhunt' and tweaked slightly to increasecontrast across the page. Blue was chosen as the heading color as it's often seen as a sign of stability and reliability making a business feel official. A darker shade being used in contrast with the two shades of gold to give a feeling of regality and professionalism. Then a soft white used as a background to provide a bright and modren feeling without being harsh to view.

### Typography:

Great Vibes was chosen for the main heading of the website and Montserrat Alternates used for all other text on the site. Great Vibes was selected because it invokes feelings of fantasy and grandeur but is still easily readable. Whilst Montserrat Alternates was chosen because of its soft curves and it's high readability.

### Imagery:

All the imagery on the sitewere sourced from free stock photo platforms and the sources are listed in the Credits section. Each photo provided supports the site's theme and attempts to display a fun and magical environment.

## Credits

Footer was either in the page, hugging the content. Or would be immobile and fix to the bottom of the original viewport.<br>
[Footer Fix](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/)<br>
Added extra 'wrapper' divs and 'content' divs across the entire site.

Problems with form overlapping with Header/Footer on smaller devices.<br>
[CSS Form Scroll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36522474/css-form-scroll-overflow)<br>
This was resolved by adding a fixed height to the element.
