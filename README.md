# Flutterwing Academy

Born from the idea of my 3 year old son, who told me one morning he didn't want to go to nursery. That his nursery and all his fellow caass mates had magically disappeared and gone to 'Flutterwing', in a town called 'Askenberg'. The fictional daycare and nursery center is now loosely based in the Harry Potter universe and the schools website is now fully functioning across all devices.

It's targetted towards wizarding parents who wish for their children to have a magical upbringing away from home. The intent is to provide the parents with knowledge about the school, it's current location and why they should choose Flutterwing.
