                        in whatever school they
                        choose.</p>

                        between 5 and 11 and provide
                        the building block and knowledge to give your magical miniatures their best. We give all of
                        the muggle basics as well as
                        building a foundation in magical creatures, wizarding history and Quidditch essentials (with
